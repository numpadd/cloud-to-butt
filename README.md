cloud-to-butt
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt'

This is my take on the amazing [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

This will still have the same functionality as the cloud to butt extension but will include additional words to make it better.
